# Playwright demo.guru99

Demo of Playwright tests against https://demo.guru99.com/V4/

This repository contains end-to-end tests written in TypeScript using `@playwright/test`.

## Requirements

- Node.js (recommended v16+)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Install the browsers used by Playwright (if not already installed):

```bash
npx playwright install
```

## Configuration

Set the credentials and the base URL in a `.env` file at the project root. Example:

```env
BASE_URL=https://demo.guru99.com/V4/
USER=[your_user]
PASSWORD=[your_password]
```

The project automatically loads environment variables from `.env` (see `playwright.config.ts`).

## Running tests

- Run all tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

- Run tests in headed mode (with browser UI):

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

- Run a single test file (example):

```bash
npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts
```

- Show the HTML report generated by Playwright:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
